##Project Organization
Please make sure you organize your repository in the following manner:

<strong>Project directores</strong> For each project you need to create a new directory. Make sure they're named "proj\<number\>". For example "proj1".

<strong>Design document</strong> Make sure your design document for each project is placed in the correct directory (per project instruction), and named "DESIGNDOC" with no extensions.
